USER INSTRUCTIONS:

You will be prompted on screen for your responses. In the case of entering a file name, enter it WITHOUT the extension. Your files will be saved to the same project folder that this project is located. Within the folder already are 3 files, called "english.txt", "portuguese.txt", and "french.txt". These are the generic files used for the English/Portuguese/French options. Please take care to see that they stay in the same folder, otherwise the program will reject the compression. Also in the folder is a test file, called sphinx.txt. It contains all the letters of the English language, and is a good general test to see if you have everything all set up right. Also note that all files must be in the .txt format.
